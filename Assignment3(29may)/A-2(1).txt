Ans 1 : There are several ways by which we can create objects of a class in java as we all know a class provides the 
blueprint for objects, you create an object from a class. This concept is under-rated  and proves to be  beneficial as this concept is bypassed by many programmers and sometimes even so ask from interviews. 

Methods
There are Many different ways to create objects in java–

A   Using new keyword
B    Using new instance
C   U sing clone() Method
D    Using Deserialization
E   Using newInstance()  method


Ans 2 : The "new" keyword in java is used to create an instance of an object. It allocates memory to an object  and  returns a reference to the object creates. It is used with a constructor to create an object.

Ans 3:   Static Variable
              Instance Variables
              Local Variables

Ans 4: Local variable: This is a variable that is declared inside the body of a method. 
It is allocated in stack. 

Instance variable: This Java variable is defined without the STATIC keyword, but as outside of a method declaration. They are object-specific variables, which is why they are known by this name

It is allocated in heap. 



Ans 5: Instance variables are allocated in the heap and local variables are allocated in the stack.

Ans 6: Method overloading in Java is a feature that allows a class to have multiple methods with the same name 
but different parameters. The Java compiler distinguishes these methods by the number, type, and order of 
parameters. Overloading is used to provide multiple ways to call a method for different use cases, making code readable and usable.
